# Operating-System-Development-Project-Microsoft-Project-Professional-
This project showcases my hands-on experience using Microsoft Project Professional to manage the lifecycle of a complex operating system development project. I created a structured Gantt Chart to visualize task dependencies, durations, and scheduling across multiple development phases. 

<b>Project Overview:</b>

This simulated project represents the complete planning and scheduling of an operating system development process. Tasks were broken down into manageable components, dependencies were identified, and proper timelines were set to align with realistic milestones.

🧩 Key Features:
✅ 19 Work Packages including software design, prototyping, testing, hardware documentation, and interface development

✅ Detailed task breakdown using WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) and Gantt chart representation

✅ Task Dependencies using predecessor logic to create a flow of dependent activities

✅ Manual Scheduling Mode to allow more control over deadlines

✅ Duration Management with task assignments ranging from short (5 days) to extended (130 days) timelines

✅ Timeline View extended over two years, allowing clear visualization of long-term and critical tasks

✅ Milestone Identification for significant development stages like hardware documentation and integration

✅ Critical Path Awareness through interlinked task dependencies

📅 Major Phases Included:
🧠 Architecture & Specifications (e.g., architecture decisions, kernel & utility specs)

🛠️ Hardware Design & Drivers (e.g., disk drivers, serial I/O, and network interfaces)

💾 Memory & OS Management (e.g., memory management, complex utilities)

📚 Documentation & Prototyping (e.g., OS documentation, hardware documentation, prototypes)

🔄 Testing & Integration (e.g., system hardware/software test, order circuit boards)

🔗 Development Wrap-Up (shell integration and interface finalization)

🎯 Outcome:
This project highlights my ability to:

Develop realistic, structured timelines for complex IT projects

Understand dependencies and scheduling logic within development pipelines

Utilize project management tools to visualize and track progress

Communicate complex project plans to technical and non-technical stakeholders

🔎 Tool Used: Microsoft Project Professional
📁 Deliverables: Gantt Chart with full timeline, task dependencies, and milestone highlights
📍 Role: Project Manager (Simulation)
